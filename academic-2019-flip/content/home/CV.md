**Matheus Cardoso** is an biotechnolgy student at the University of Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil. He currently internships in the bioinformatics laboratory of the university's cell biology department. His research seeks to develop software that analyzes phage display libraries and returns, as a result, the most efficiently enriched antibodies, thus providing tools for future research in vaccine development.
