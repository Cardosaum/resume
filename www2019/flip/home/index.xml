      <description>Flip Tanedo spends a lot of time thinking about dark matter.
He grew up in Los Angeles and fell in love with physics after reading The Physics of Star Trek. This carried into degrees in mathematics and physics at Stanford, Cambridge, Durham, and a Ph.D at Cornell. After a postdoc at UC Irvine, he is currently faculty at UC Riverside where he is known for being covered in chalk dust after a long day&amp;rsquo;s work.</description>

      <description>A goal of dark matter phenomenology is to translate the results of experimental searches into numerical values of our theories of new physics. My primary interest is to develop novel theories of dark matter that can push beyond the limits of our present phenomenological lamp post with unique experimental opportunities.</description>

      <description>Prospective graduate students should review these lectures.
I am currently not taking new PhD students, but welcome inquiries about joining the UCR Particle Theory Group. We are committed to inclusion and I especially encourage women and under-represented minorities to consider our group.</description>
